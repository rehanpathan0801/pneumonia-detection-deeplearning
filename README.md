### 🧠 Model Architecture

The project uses MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor because it is:

- Efficient

- Lightweight

- Accurate

- Suitable for medical imaging transfer learning

- Load MobileNetV2 with pretrained ImageNet weights

- Freeze base layers

- Train custom dense layers

- Unfreeze top layers for fine-tuning

### ⭐ Overall Accuracy: 86%
🔍 Grad-CAM Visualizations

---
![GradCAM Example](assets/gradcam_examples/gradcam.png)


Grad-CAM heatmaps highlight lung regions responsible for model predictions.

Red → High importance

Blue → Low importance

This adds explainability, which is crucial for medical AI applications.
